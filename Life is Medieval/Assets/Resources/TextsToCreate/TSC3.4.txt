What almost felt like an eternity, had now come to an end. As everyone gathers outside the church you feel the longing to go look for the girl.
“Go be with the other kids,” your father tells you, as both your parents begin to converse with the other villagers. You dash through at least twenty people before you finally see her and slow down as you approach her. She hasn’t taken notice of you yet, and to your displeasement you see that she’s already talking to a boy. From the looks of it he is not an ordinary peasant boy either – rather he seems to be quite well off wearing a nice dark leather attire.
