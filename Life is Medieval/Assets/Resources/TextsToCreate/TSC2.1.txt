Today is a new day, the weather is a blessing, and to your surprise neither of your parents has left to attend their labor. “Verner, today we may spend our time together as a family,” your father says, and looks at you and your mother with a smile. “I say we pack our things and settle on the field by the forest,” your mother replies. The warmth of the sun and the smell of summer engulf your senses as you all sit down in the field of grass. You can tell there is something going on as your parents look at each other longingly. It comes to you as no surprise when your father asks you to go and play. “Verner, when I was your age my curiosity had me running around these lands till my feet had blisters all over them… there’s some ruins up there,” he points to the north, “then there’s the forest to the east, but don’t get lost there… now go have some fun while me and your mother have some time of our own.”
