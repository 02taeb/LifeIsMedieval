Something is off this morning. You're all sitting at the food table and both your parents are eyeing you more than usual. “Verner… we think it’s time you start helping the family,” your father says, as your mother nods in agreement. “You could help me at the blacksmith, there is nothing better than to strike hot iron, son! It will strengthen your body immensely!”
“Or,” your mother says, “you could help out aunt Gunhild at the infirmary, she will teach you how to mend the body, a skill that will surely be helpful here.”
“If that doesn’t sound interesting to you,” your father continues, “we’ll let you come up with something else, just as long as it’s not a waste of time and that it actually helps the family, understood?”
