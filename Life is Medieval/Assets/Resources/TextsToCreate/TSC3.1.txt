It seems as if the whole village had decided to come today. All the benches are filled to the brink on each side, and those who came in last are standing in the back. You turn your head around with watchful eyes and see some familiar faces, as well as some you havenâ€™t seen before. On the other side of the aisle your face comes to a halt as your eyes lock themselves with a pair of pearly blues belonging to a young and beautiful girl. Never have you ever been so enchanted by anyone before. She smiles at you and subtly waves her hand.
