“I don’t think you would be talking to me this way if you knew anything about me,” you say while staring daggers into his eyes. “Ha! Why should I know anything about a bag of dirt like you?!” He burst out with a scoff. Before you get to reply, the girl leans toward him and says – just barely loud enough for you to hear, “I think he is the one everyone’s been talking about, you know… the one who took care of Richard…”\nJust like a deflated balloon, all his arrogance just vanishes in front of your eyes. Apparently he’s not too eager to walk in Richard's footsteps.\n“Ah, Saga… I must go, my father is probably waiting for me,” he says, with a shaky voice before storming off. \n“Did I do him a favor?” she asks after he’s gone. “Perhaps you did us both a favor,” you reply. “I also have to be on my way, perhaps we can talk more some other time?” She says, and smiles at you before leaving.
“I don’t think you would be talking to me this way if you knew anything about me,” you say while staring daggers into his eyes. “Ha! Why should I know anything about a thin little bag of dirt like you?!” He burst out with a scoff. Before you get to reply, the girl leans toward him and says – just barely loud enough for you to hear, “I think he is the one everyone’s been talking about, you know… the one who took care of Richard…”\nHe looks at her with a puzzled look on his face, “You mean to tell me this brittle stick of a boy is that guy? Don’t jest me like that, Saga. And you,” he says, and push you so hard you fall on your back, “fuck off!”\nYou feel like the humiliation of lying in the dirt just saps all the energy out of you, and you decide it’s better to leave. You’re not strong enough to fight him.

“Well, I rather look like dirt than shit – and you look like you just crawled out of a bear’s ass,” you reply instantaneously with such a flawless delivery, that everyone standing around burst out in laughter. Even the girl he stands beside cannot keep herself from laughter.\nFeeling the massive humiliation of being laughed at by everyone around, he tries desperately to come up with a sufficient retort – but just fails miserably. Defeated, he just storms off, leaving the two of you standing there.\n“You are quite clever with your words… I’m Saga,” she says and smiles. “I’m Verner, it’s nice to meet you.”\nYou hear someone yell out her name, and the brief moment you have together expires as she has to leave. “I hope to see you again, Verner,” she says, before going to her father.
“Well…” you begin to say, but your mind is empty, and there is no witty comeback coming out of your mouth. “Well, what? Run off, before you lose more than your words…” he tells you, giving you a stern look. You feel like his words just saps your energy right out of you, and with a defeated look on your face you walk away.

You waste no time thinking what to do – the plan has already formed itself in your mind. You abruptly fall to one knee and lower your head. “M’lord, I was sent by the custodian to fetch you!”\n“Aye, then speak up serf!”\n“You are to meet with the scribe in the castle’s tower, knock twice while you’re there and wait till he opens,” you say in such a convincing manner that he cannot help not to believe your words. “M’lady Saga, I bid you farewell. I will have my name written down in the books this afternoon it seems!” He tells her, before he storms off.\n“Since when does the scribe work on Sundays?” She asks you, noticeably aware of the prank you’ve just pulled off. “It got him to leave, didn’t it?” You reply with a shrug. “Knowing him, his ego won’t let him leave until the scribe comes in the morning,” she says and laughs, “you are something else, I hope we will talk some other time – for I’m afraid I must leave now.”\nYou watch as she leaves.
