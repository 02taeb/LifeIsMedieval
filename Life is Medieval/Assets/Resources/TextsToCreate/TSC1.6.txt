Days turn into weeks, weeks into months, and all the while you are learning more and more as time flies by. Even as you fall asleep every night hungry – you’re filled with the love from your parents. Eventually, the words they say start to mean something. Mother is always telling father of the drama at the Groenhart’s estate, where she works as a maid. Father always comforts her when she’s on the receiving end of the master's wrath. It’s hard to fully grasp what it all means, but it’s clear to you when they are happy and when they’re not.
