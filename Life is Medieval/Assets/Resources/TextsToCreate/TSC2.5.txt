You do as you're told and wander aimlessly through the village until you hear the sound of children's laughter coming from behind a set of trees. ”And who might you be then?” One of the boys says, as you make your way into their playground. “My name is Verner, I’m the son of Oscar the smith,” you reply. “Right, I’m Richard, and I guess you thought you could just stroll in here just like that, aye?” The boy says and gestures with his hands at the dirt around him. “My father says that God hates cowards, so yes – just like that,” you reply rather calmly.
