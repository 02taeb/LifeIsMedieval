“I’ve been waiting for this day, Father!” you say standing up. Your father glows up with pride, and lifts you up with a strong hug. “Let’s make ready for a long day, my son.” He says and tosses you a black apron. After a walk through the village, your father opens up the door to his workplace and begins a guided tour for you. Showing you all the tools and material, there is a lot to take in but once you get to swing the hammer on hot red iron, you know you’ve come to the right place. Afterwards, you feel how every muscle in your body is sore and in need of rest.

“I wish to help aunt Gunhild and learn about medicine,” you reply. “That is great!” Your mother says and clasps her hands together, “I will tell you how to get there.” You listen carefully at your mother’s instruction and soon thereafter you’re on your way to aunt Gunhild. As you enter the infirmary she greets you with a warm welcome, and without any more delay she begins to give you a guided tour of the place. She seems to have an answer for every question, and after a long day by her side treating the ill you feel as if your mind is exhausted and in need of a long night’s rest.

“I will make sure that by the end of this day, I will have made you both proud,” you say, but your parents aren’t looking entirely convinced. Nevertheless, they agree to let you come up with something. Roaming around the village you end up watching some men play with dice outside the inn, and it isn’t just for fun – it’s for money as well, a lot of money by your standards. Deciding to remain watchful from a distance, you wait to see who will end up with all the coins, and as dusk comes near, an opportunity presents itself to you. “Look…” one of the men says and points at a curvy woman walking by, “have you lads ever been with a woman like…?” another of them asks as they’re eyes are mesmerized by her beauty. You don’t hesitate for a second, like a falcon you silently swoop in to pick a few coins out of the sack before the men turn back. Completely unaware of what just happened, they carry on while you make your way home, thinking of what you should say when they ask you how you got those coins.
