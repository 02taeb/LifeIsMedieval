You raise your clenched fist holding the pointy pebble into the air, and with a decisive blow you strike the snake on its head. You watch as the snake rattles uncontrollably a few seconds before it dies. “My God, Verner!” Your mother exclaims in panic, as she comes back and kicks the dead snake away from you. “Have you gone mad?! Just wait till your father hears of this!” She scolds you. “He did what?!” Your father says, after your mother brings you home. “Oscar, he killed a snake! A small child should not be fighting snakes! He could’ve missed and been bitten!” “Aye… Verner, don’t put your mother through this ever again!” Your father says, and then as she turns around he whispers to you: “I’m proud of you, my little snakeslayer!”

The snake slithers away through the grass, and shortly thereafter it’s gone. Your mother comes back and smiles as she sees you. “It’s time we head back for dinner, my son,” she says and lifts you up. Knowing your mother has a fragile heart, you're glad she didn’t see the snake.

You quickly realize that the snake halts when it perceives a threat. With one hand in front of it you keep it distracted, while with the other hand you prepare for its capture. A small piece of cloth and a string will have to suffice, and surely enough – you manage to cover the snake with it and tie it up into a neat little sack of cloth. As you notice your mother coming back you quickly pocket the sack of cloth into your trousers. Later that night, while everyone’s asleep, you release the snake into the hole in the wall where the house mouse resides.
