Time is ticking, and a choice needs to be made. You could pick up the sword belonging to the dead bandit and help the bailiff win the fight. Or, perhaps fighting them will only get you killed, it might be wiser to distract them and have the bailiff cease the opportunity to strike… Then you could try to mend his wounds as well. Then an unusual thought comes to mind: What if you help the bandits, join them under false pretense in order to get a hold of Saga that they’ve abducted?
