“Help me get to the castle, boy,” the bailiff orders you. You do your best to help him stay on his feet as you escort him out of the village and towards the castle grounds. “If it weren’t for you, I’d be done for… you saved me boy, what’s your name?” he asks you. “My name is Verner, son of Oscar the smith,” you reply back. “Well, Verner… Once I’ve recovered from my wounds I will make sure you will have a bright future as an apprentice under the Lord’s Master-of-Arms,” he tells you. As soon as you make it to the castle you’re met by a dozen of the Lord’s retinues clad in full armor, on their way to fight the remaining bandits. 
You manage to disrobe him of his harness and stop the bleeding, as you come in contact with his wound he groans of pain and grabs a hold of you, “You must help me get to the castle, now at once boy!” he orders you.

“What would we need you for?” One of the bandits replies. You point your sword at the corpse of the bandit that the bailiff had killed, “if it weren’t for me this might have been your fate as well.” The other bandit shrugs, “I say we let him come with… boss always likes the coldblooded ones.” “Fair enough, we best be leavin’ before the Lord’s retinue comes, come on boy! Help us carry the loot! Move yer ass!”
